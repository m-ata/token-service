# Token-Service

A generic token service that implements token authentication together with refresh refresh token functionality and logout.

# Tech Stack
In this token-service, I used the following technologies:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Typescript
- Json web token
- MongoDB as database

Looking forward to implement unit test using jest. I'll implement it later.

Enjoy coding :blush:
